        <h2>üìú My story</h2>
        <p>
          This is a wise old owl story for kids. Once upon a time, a group of
          owls came to settle in a forest. This forest had many beautiful lush
          green trees. All the owls in the group were free to choose whichever
          tree they liked. So, the young owls greedily chose all the green
          trees. There they built their new homes. However, there was an old owl
          also amongst them. He was forced to build his nest in an old, dried up
          oak tree. Without much of a choice, the old owl settled there. Also,

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Anatomy</h2>

        <p>
          Owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like
          beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a
          facial disc, around each eye. The feathers making up this disc can be
          adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls'
          asymmetrically placed ear cavities. Most birds of prey have eyes on
          the sides of their heads, but the stereoscopic nature of the owl's
          forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception
          necessary for low-light hunting.
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Vision</h2>

        <p>
          Eyesight is a particular characteristic of the owl that aids in
          nocturnal prey capture. Owls are part of a small group of birds that
          live nocturnally, but do not use echolocation to guide them in flight
          in low-light situations. Owls are known for their disproportionally
          large eyes in comparison to their skulls. An apparent consequence of
          the evolution of an absolutely large eye in a relatively small skull
          is that the eye of the owl has become tubular in shape. This shape is
          found in other so-called nocturnal eyes, such as the eyes of
          strepsirrhine primates and bathypelagic fishes.

        <h2>üåÆ Work History</h2>

        <h3>Hunting</h3>
        <p>
          All owls are carnivorous birds of prey and live on diets of insects,
          small rodents and lagomorphs. Some owls are also specifically adapted
          to hunt fish. They are very adept in hunting in their respective
          environments. Since owls can be found in nearly all parts of the world
          and across a multitude of ecosystems, their hunting skills and
          characteristics vary slightly from species to species, though most
          characteristics are shared among all species.
        </p>
        <h3>Camouflage</h3>
        <p>
          The coloration of the owl's plumage plays a key role in its ability to
          sit still and blend into the environment, making it nearly invisible
          to prey. Owls tend to mimic the coloration and sometimes the texture
          patterns of their surroundings, the barn owl being an exception. The
          snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) appears nearly bleach-white in color with
          a few flecks of black, mimicking their snowy surroundings perfectly,
          while the speckled brown plumage of the tawny owl (Strix aluco) allows
          it to lie in wait among the deciduous woodland it prefers for its
          habitat. Likewise, the mottled wood-owl (Strix ocellata) displays
          shades of brown, tan and black, making the owl nearly invisible in the
          surrounding trees, especially from behind. Usually, the only tell-tale
          sign of a perched owl is its vocalizations or its vividly colored
          eyes.unt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
